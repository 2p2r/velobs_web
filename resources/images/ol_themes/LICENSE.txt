We have integrated automatic color change using Python to original source.
We change original svg ol_labeled. You have to keep directories structure
e.g input-svg for source, ouput-svg for generated svg and output-png for
final png. We take inspiration for directories structure and for the color code used from a previous
job done by Marc Jansen (we rewrite all code for self learning purpose)
